# Jorman's Porfolio

hi, I'm Jorman Israel, this page contains a few of my recent school work, hope you find it interesting, this porfolio page 
itself is a school project by far one of my favorites. it's very simple page built around htlm, css and a bit of javascript.

take a look and show some love!! happy coding.
